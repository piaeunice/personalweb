                    <img src="./images/articles/editorial.jpg" alt="UniTeam-porary Stability" class="article-img">
                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p>What began as a united front under the “UniTeam” banner has disintegrated into a bitter feud, leaving Filipinos questioning the future of governance under President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. and Vice President Sara Duterte. Once celebrated as a partnership of unity and progress, their alliance now serves as a somber reminder of political fragility and opportunism.</p>
                        
                        <p>The roots of their partnership was grounded in a strategic electoral alliance: the Marcos legacy dominating the North and the Dutertes’ influence established in the South. This calculated collaboration secured a decisive victory in 2022, presenting the image of a coalition built on strength and stability. However, cracks in their relationship began to emerge shortly after they assumed office, fueled by disagreements over priorities, leadership dynamics, and unmet expectations.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The first major sign of discord came when Duterte resigned from Lakas-CMD, the political party instrumental in their campaign, citing personal and political reasons. This move exposed a growing rift between the two leaders and their respective camps. Since then, the conflict has escalated, with both sides exchanging implicit accusations, threats, and criticisms. Duterte has accused unnamed officials of discrediting her leadership, while Marcos’ allies have responded with equal fervor, deepening the divide.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>This feud has significant implications for the Philippines. With the two highest-ranking officials involved in a public power struggle, the administration’s focus in addressing pressing issues—poverty, inflation, and education—is at risk of being overshadowed by political disagreement. Their fallout also highlights the inherent weakness of alliances built on political convenience rather than shared principles. The administration’s inability to present a cohesive front undermines public trust and fuels uncertainty, threatening governance and stability at a time when decisive leadership is needed most.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Moreover, the rivalry disrupts the narrative of unity and progress that the “UniTeam” promised. The partnership, once hailed as a beacon of national consolidation, now symbolizes a missed opportunity to achieve meaningful collaboration for the greater good. It emphasizes the dangers of prioritizing personalities over platforms, leaving Filipinos frustrated with the political system.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For the Filipino people, the Marcos-Duterte fallout serves as a clear reminder of the importance of leadership anchored in accountability, genuine unity, and a shared vision. As the nation watches this political drama unfold, there is a growing call for leaders to set aside personal rivalries and refocus on their mandate to serve the public. Governance, after all, is not a stage for personal feuds but a responsibility to ensure the nation’s progress and stability.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>While the future of this alliance remains uncertain, one thing is clear: the country deserves leaders who place national interests above political maneuvering. The time for unity is now—not just as a campaign slogan, but as a genuine commitment to the Filipino people.
                        </p>
